## How to approach a Machine Learning Project

1. Understand the business requirements and the nature of the available data.
2. Classify the problem as supervised/unsupervised and regression/classification.
3. Download, clean & explore the data and create new features that may improve models.
4. Create training/test/validation sets and prepare the data for training ML models.
5. Create a quick & easy baseline model to evaluate and benchmark future models.
6. Pick a modeling strategy, train a model, and tune hyperparameters to achieve optimal fit.
7. Experiment and combine results from multiple strategies to get a better result.
8. Interpret models, study individual predictions, and present your findings.
